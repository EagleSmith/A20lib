# A20lib
An *VERY* early stage ESP8266/Arduino library for communicating with the A20 GSM module. 
Based 99% in the github repository skorokithakis/A6lib.

This Ai-Thinker module is still very new for the comunity...
And in Arduino I cant make it work with the SoftwareUart library so I use the RX/TX pins of the integrated ESP8285.
