A20 Module Details
----------------------------------------

Part of the docs are in 
http://www.electrodragon.com/w/GSM_GPRS_A6_Module#A20_Module

This module was created to use de ESP8285 MCU to control or not the GPRS Module,
so there is a Switches that let connect internally GPIO13 and GPIO15 with the
UART_RX and UART_TX,
GPIO13 (SoftwareSerial_RX) address UART_TX
GPIO15 (SoftwareSerialTX) address  UART_RX.
But viua software I cannot make it work, 115200 bauds it's too much?
So I direct connect WIFI_RX and WIFI_TX to UART.

I already tried use 13,15 pins in Arduino with Serial.swap() but...

wf_xx are chip pins
uart_xx are chip pins

wifi_xx are board pins
u_xx son are board pins

LEFT.: chip RIGHT: pins
ON connected.

Used configuration:

6 uart_rxd ON u_rxd
5 uart_rxd OFF wifi_io15
4 uart_txd ON  u_txd
3 uart_txd OFF wifi_io13
2 wf_io15  ON  wifi_io15 
1 wf_io13  ON  wifi_io13


Desired configuration (not working)

5 uart_rxd ON  wifi_io15
4 uart_txd OFF u_txd
3 uart_txd ON  wifi_io13
2 wf_io15  OFF wifi_io15 
1 wf_io13  OFF wifi_io13
